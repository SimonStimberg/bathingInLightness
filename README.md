Bathing in Lightness is an interactive audio-visual installation that reflects on our relationship towards the Machine as such, regarding the way we tend to perceive the apparati around us as living beings with a life of its own. The installation features a swarm intelligence inside a virtual - yet physical - goldfish bowl, exploring its tiny universe and trying to communicate with the outer world. The swarm imagines its own interpretation of reality, while reflecting the presence of visitors moving in front of the piece. 

Build out of a commonly sensed longing for analogue, thus easy understandable mechanisms, the installation's basic component represents the archetype of electric machines: the incandescent light bulb. Thereby the installation acts as an analogue interface through which the visitor can make contact with a virtual being while breaching the digital realm, provoking to contemplate on her/his relationship towards the artificial entity. Along with a calm and soothing sonification of the swarms movements, we are allured to rest in front of the piece as we would by warming ourselves at a cosy campfire, remembering us of ancient and more leisurely paced times.

The installation can be interacted with by moving in front of it.
